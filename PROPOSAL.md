# Final Project Proposal:

### Idea:
For the final project, my proposal is to make a two-player game of pong 
which can be played on the same computer using the _wasd_ keys and the arrow keys. 
The game would keep track of each player's score and after a certain score was reached, 
one of the players would win. 

### Motivation:
My first console growing up was my mom's old _Atari_ and one of the few games she had on it was pong. 
I wasn't too particularly good at the game but I had fun playing it nonetheless which is why I want
to try and recreate it using Cinder. As for background knowledge, I'm already familiar with the rules
of pong so I won't have to spend time learning its rules or scoring mechanism. 

### Project Timeline:
* By the end of the first week, I hope to have my CMake file, two paddles, and the ball appear on the screen.
* By the end of the second week, I plan to have completed the interactions between the ball and paddles as well as finish
the scoring mechanics.
* By the end of the last week, I'll have the final product finished with at least two out of three stretch features implemented.

###  Stretch Goals:
One of my biggest gripes with Pong when I used to play it was that it was difficult for new 
players to play against people who had a lot of experience, so many of my stretch goals revolve 
including some handicaps that might make the game easier for a certain player (or both).

__Handicaps__:
1) Make the paddle longer for one player.
2) Make a player's paddle movement speed increase as their score increases allowing time 
for the other player to catch up.
3) Reduce the score necessary for a certain player to win.

__Other Stretch Goals__:
1) Make the paddles customizable with different skins other than just the standard white rectangle.
2) Implementing a database that keeps track of previous game records 
    1) The final score, the names of the players, and which side they each played on.
